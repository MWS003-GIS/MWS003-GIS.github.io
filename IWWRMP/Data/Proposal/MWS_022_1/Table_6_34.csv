"Overall Goal","X Sustainably manage forest resources in the Upper Mahaweli mini watersheds to improve water quantity  quality  and availability"
,
"Objectives 1: To enhance forest cover for sustainable delivery of hydrological benefits and other co-benefits",
"Outputs","Activities"
"Deforestation and degradation of forests in watershed areas reduced","1.1.1 Include, implement, and monitor activities in the mini watershed management plans into range Management Plans."
"1.2 Legal protection for forests strengthened","1.2.1 Surveying of forest boundaries (By Survey department or using GPS)"
,"1.2.2 Preparation of boundary schedules"
"1.3 Physical protection measures implemented.","1.3.1 Production or Procurement of boundary posts"
,"1.3.2 Erection of boundary posts"
"1.4 Identified deforested areas reforested and restored.","1.4.2 Map degraded areas"
,"1.4.2 Map degraded areas"
,"1.4.3 Include into annual work plans"
,"1.4.4 Raise seedlings"
,"1.4.5 Reforestation with appropriate technology (ANR/Enrichment planting/ Gap planting etc.)"
"1.5 Identified deforested areas outside the forest boundary reforested and restored.","1.5.1 Identified degraded forests"
,"1.5.2 Map degraded areas"
,"1.5.3 Include into annual work plans"
,"1.5.4 Raise seedlings"
,"1.5.5 Reforestation with appropriate technology (ANR/Enrichment planting/ Gap planting etc.)"
"1.6 Fire destruction hazards minimized.","1.6.1 Identify and map fire-prone forest areas (Using web-based data and fire records)."
,"1.6.2 Apply fire prevention methods. (Re-opening existing fire belts, opening new fire belts, establishing live fences etc.)"
,"1.6.3 Establish vigilant community groups for fire-tracking and rapid response."
,"1.6.4 Create awareness in communities, school children, and the general public about forest fires"
"1.7 Reforestation with broadleaved species in place of pines.","1.7.1 Identify pine plantations to be converted into broadleaved species according to the FD criteria."
,"1.7.2 Include into annual work plans"
,"1.7.3 Raise seedlings"
,"1.7.4 Conversion with appropriate technology (Strip felling and planting/Gap opening/ Girdling and allow natural regeneration/ clear felling and planting etc.)"
"Objectives 2. To reduce soil erosion and improve soil fertility in critical areas.",
"2.1 Degraded forest areas and riverine vegetation restored, and soil erosion minimized","2.1.1 Restore degraded stream reservations."
,"2.1.2 Apply soil conservation measures in production Forest Plantations."
,"2.1.3 Identify and establish biological and mechanical barriers and measures to prevent soil movements and improve groundwater recharge."
,"2.1.4 Regulate illegal tapping of water from water sources in the forests while promoting community water supply schemes."
"2.2 Convert annual vegetable cultivations into less effective for hydrological retention to more sustainable perennial cultivations.","2.2.1 Suitable multi crop gardening design has to create and interduce by considering Economic viability, Suitability for high altitude condition, water and other ecosystem services restoration ability."
,"2.2.2. interduce best post harvesting value-added techniques."
,"2.2.3. Introduce of best practice certification systems (organic and other) for sustainable farming. (eg. Specialty coffee, Geographical indication)"
"3. To strengthen local communitiesâ€™ capacity for sustainable resource management and livelihood development.",
"3.1 Community awareness and involvement in watershed protection increased.","3.1.1 Conduct community training and awareness programs."
,"3.1.2. Conduct school training and awareness programs."
