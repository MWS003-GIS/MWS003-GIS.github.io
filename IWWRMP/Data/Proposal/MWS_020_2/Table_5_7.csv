"Observations / Damages/Requests","Shallow tank bed due to siltation. Small bund top width","Farmers request to replace Pine plantation, Bund strengthening"
"Recommendation","1.Excavate upstream tank bed to a depth of 500mm. 
2.Bund Raise by 500mm and make the Bund top width as 3m with 1:2.5 side slopes using excavated materials.
3. Full turfing, Vetiver grass and areca edges along the HFL contour.","1.Tank widening by removing the earth and silt deposits. 
2. Upstream bund earth filling about 75m length to correct depressions, irregularities
3. Dense forest belt in immediate catchment"
