Observations / Damages,1. Dam failure - at LB side,1. Seepage under the spill 
,2. Spill is size- not sufficient,2. Peripheral ground erosion
,3. Clearing of forest for Cultivation - inside the catchment,3. Sand bags provided at D/S of the spill prevent water leaks
,4. Sluice is not operable,
Recommendation         ,1.    Demolish the concrete wall and re-construct an earthen bund with 1:2    US/Ds slopes.,"1.    Provide concrete cut-off wall, clay blanket, and clay core in the vicinity of the spill   "
,2.    Provide U/S geotextile and reno mattress protection,"2.    Provide a sluice, sediment ejector, and spill gates "
,3.    Construct RCC morning glory type spill (or optional structure) with a 1.2m D stem/ barrel and 4m (top edge) diameter funnel,"3.    Bund strengthening, Desilting, and protection against erosion by stone walls, terracing, and perennial crops."
,4.    Re-construct the sluice structure with 300mm diameter pipe,4.    Build an intake well with an infiltration gallery or filtering system before pumping.
,5.    600 m2 dense natural reforestation for the upper catchment area,5.    500 m2 dense natural vegetation with vetiver grass edge
